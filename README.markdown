This repo holds the actual articles for my personal blog. [Nabe](https://github.com/mklabs/nabe) is now used as a blog engine which is based on git filefilesystem and written to run in node.js. The whole idea is coming from [Wheat](https://github.com/creationix/wheat), inspiration and motivation comes from this fantastic application. If you're seeking for a good bloging solution, running in node + git support. You should give Wheat a try, it's pretty awesome.

Nabe itself was written way later once great modules such as connect or express, it's built right on top of connect.

One can easily think of writing the same kind of application with express. It's a fantastic way to dive into node.
